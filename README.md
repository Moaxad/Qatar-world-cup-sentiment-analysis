# Qatar-world-cup-sentiment-analysis
This project aims to analyze Saudi Arabia's Tweets during their contributions to Qatar World Cup 2022 matches.
I used a pre-trained sentiment analysis model that analyzes the tweets as positive or negative with a score range from -1 to +1.
Also, I used different data analysis techniques to visualize the data after cleaning to understand the behaviour of Saudi fans during the Saudi vs. Argentina match.
